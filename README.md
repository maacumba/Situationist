Achei interessante a idéia de um mapa de navegação relacionado com os SSID das wifi que aparecem no percurso.




### "All space is occupied by the enemy. We are living under a permanent curfew. Not just the cops — the geometry"

In his manifesto for unitary urbanism, [Raoul Vaneigem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Vaneigem "Raoul Vaneigem") articulated some further ideas behind the _dérive_ and the Situationist critique of space: "All space is occupied by the enemy. We are living under a permanent curfew. Not just the cops — the geometry".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive#cite_note-6) _Dérive_, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive#cite_note-7) To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the _dérive_ brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation.

> The sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres; the [path of least resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_least_resistance "Path of least resistance") that is automatically followed in aimless strolls (and which has no relation to the physical contour of the terrain); the appealing or repelling character of certain places—these phenomena all seem to be neglected. In any case they are never envisaged as depending on causes that can be uncovered by careful analysis and turned to account.

_Dérives_ are necessary, according to Situationist theory, because of the increasingly predictable and monotonous experience of [everyday life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_life "Everyday life") in [advanced capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_capitalism "Advanced capitalism").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive#cite_note-Debord1956Theory-1)

Space is not a scientific object removed from ideology or politics; it has always been political and strategic (…) Space has been shaped and molded from historical and natural elements; but this has been a political process. Space is both political and ideological. (…) It is a product literally filled with ideologies (1976: 31).

**Psy-Geo-Conflux** (better known as **Conflux**) is an annual [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") festival dedicated to [psychogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography "Psychogeography"), where visual, performance and sound artists, writers, urban adventurers, researchers and the public gather for four days to explore the physical and psychological landscape of the city.

**PSY-GEO-CONFLUX**  
THURS.-SUN., MAY 13-16

FRANCE, 1955: Situationist Guy Debord defines the new field of psychogeography as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behaviors of individuals."

Sound like a recipe for disaster? Or the caption of your day-to-day? Then come join psychogeographers at work and play this weekend, as the second annual Psy-Geo-Conflux convenes around the city. Presented by Glowlab and Participant, Inc., Conflux events range from Lower East Side techno-drifts to a Fugitive Love Hunt in Central Park, and include a chess game played on South Williamsburg streets using human pieces moved via cellphone.

Co-organizer David Mandl calls psychogeography a "utopian way of making our urban place more passionate and exciting." He cites the field's 50s originators, "the artists and hardcore lefties who would explore Paris using another city's map, or drift aimlessly to experience places they saw all the time in new ways."

This year's city overlayers navigate Manhattan with a map of Copenhagen provided by participants from that city (others hail from Rotterdam, Berlin, Lisbon, San Francisco). Julian **Bleecker wanders for WiFi nodes (wireless Internet connections) while composing haikus from the nodes' SSID names.**

Mandl and co-organizer Christina Ray (Glowlab's founder) present One Block Radius, a multimedia survey of the Bowery block where the New Museum will build its big new facility later this year. With copious photos, videos and scavenged objects, they've compiled "not only physical data," says Ray, "but also unusual and quirky data: how many bottle caps we saw or what the weather was like on a particular day. It's a guidebook, but we crammed as much information as you usually get on a whole city from a single block."

A 24-hour, five-borough roadtrip maps progress on a website, allowing participants to join up for, say, a fishing break. Most events take about two hours, out and back from the Conflux's HQ on Rivington St. Categories include "Navigate" for mobile activities and "Speak" for lectures. "Strike" covers street actions like Mobile Coffee Unit, distributing free coffee and engaging in random conversations, and Yankee Game Walk, which has Lee Walton responding to a headphone broadcast, "a wildly choreographed performance piece dictated by the Yankees game," according to Mandl. That the source of Walton's antics may be lost on passersby is no surprise for psychogeographers, as they both undermine and expand our common sense of place.

### APPLICATIVO
A smartphone app named Dérive was developed in the 21st century by a team including Eduardo Cachucho and Babak Fakhamzadeh. The smartphone app shows a series of simple geography-based directions on a mobile device's screen such as "follow a red vehicle" to create the _dérive_ experience.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive#cite_note-8)

There is also a similar application with the same name from a Russian developer who does not require installation and works directly in a browser with an additional mapping drift mode, where the application generates a point on the map to move to.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive#cite_note-9)

In March 2020, an iOS and Android app called [Randonautica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randonautica "Randonautica") launched and cited [Guy Debord's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Debord "Guy Debord") essay on _dérive_ as a core inspiration. It uses a [random number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator "Random number generator") to seed a random map location that the user is prompted to walk to while holding an intention in mind.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive#cite_note-10)

# How did Situationism Influence Art History?

![[Pasted image 20230518225235.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230518225258.png]]

It is rare for an art movement to be completely original. The _go forward_ meanings of [avant-garde](https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/avant-garde-movement-theater-music-photography-contemporary-art/) do not mean that its movements are a _tabula rasa_ and this is certainly true for **Situationism**. Spurred by many previous concepts, this artistic and political movement started emerging during the early 1960s in France and it experimented with the idea of _constructing a situation_ - hence the name. Constructing a situation was setting up an environment favorable for the fulfillment of a particular desire. This was the main concept for all representatives of Situationism[1]. All of the initial theories concerning the development of this movement came from an organization called **Situationist International** (often referred to simply as **SI**) - a group whose activities we shell investigate to detail in the remainder of this text.
